TODO NEW JSON SYSTEM
    put update habitsdb/daily task in all the habitsdb
    read from the db for setting the icon colors
    move everything used over to a new activity to clean up what is no longer needed
    deal with todos_done
    make a counter that sees how many days the streak for each one is, and the dadys without, and the longest streak
        put all this info in the label of each icon

we may want some automatic backup system since the db gets totally cleared if there is a bug

todos_done needs special attention

make a check if a task exists when we add counter to it,
    if it doesnt exist, flash that a new habit has been made

always check before writing db that there actually is a db there

set up both systems to work together at first
when i push a habit button, add that number to the most recent entry of that habit
when i hit + , add the next dates up until today, and intermediate dates that were not listed or are today should get 0s
