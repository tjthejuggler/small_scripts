move everything used over to a new activity to clean up what is no longer needed

make a check if a task exists when we add counter to it,
    if it doesnt exist, flash that a new habit has been made

NICE:
when i write the db file from tasker, it would be nice it it put everything in order like when i output from python
when i click a habit it updates the current streak length
